## Career Objectives
- I am looking forward to combining my love for finance, math, and working others into one career. I thrive in a team environment and have held various leadership roles in and outside of Lehigh. 
- In June, I will begin an internship at Syncarpha Capital on their Assest Management team in Radnor, Pennsylvania. I am excited to work for a company that has a positive impact on the world around us. 
- After working in finance or a finance related field for a long time, I hope to become a teacher. 

## My Free Time! 
- Running is a great way for me to relieve stress and clear my head. I just ran my first half marathon last weekend!
- I also love to go to the beach, go on hikes, swim, and spend time with my family and friends.
